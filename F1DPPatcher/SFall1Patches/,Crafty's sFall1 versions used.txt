Currently, this is Crafty's sFall1 version 1.7.20. It has only a thing from version 1.8 which I've limited the sound
buffers to 4 as it's done on that version. All the rest is from 1.7.20, if I didn't miss anything.

For now it's only 1.7.20, as I need to get back to study-mode, but later I'll ask IDA's help on newer versions. When I
do that, I'll put the changes here from 1.7.20 vs that version, having always version 1.7.20 in mind, which is the
last with available source code (even though that goes against the GPL license agreement).

So far I could not find any version other than the most recent 1.8. All above 1.7.20 are pure Assembly versions, and the
code is a mess such that IDA cannot disassemble it decently. I can more or less still understand parts of it, so it's
more or less possible to port some things from those pure-ASM versions (some other time though, as I said above).

When a file is updated to version 1.8, just above the main function of the file there will be a string saying just that:
"Entire file updated to version 1.8". Currently only the very easy ones. The others will be later as I said above.
