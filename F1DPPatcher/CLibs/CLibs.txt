Here are all the C standard functions that can be used on this program. More can be added, either with a manual
implementation (as last resource in case the game doesn't include the function), or with adding an Assembly
implementation to call the game's included functions.d

All this is defined in IEEE P1003.1â„¢ (POSIX 1003.1) - the same that Watcom uses (some functions may not be on the
standard).
Notice: all functions assume that when not ready addresses are given to them, that they meant to point to the data
section. So any pointers are automatically corrected with getRealBlockAddrData().
Note about the notice above: if the pointer is already corrected to point to the code section (because something in
use is in the code section), then that pointer will NOT be re-corrected (because of getRealBlockAddrData()'s
implementation of not correcting anything >= SN_CODE_SEC_BLOCK_ADDR).

The main register used to call the functions is EDI because as a start, the 4 main ones are used to pass parameters
to the functions (in Watcom's calling convention order, EAX, EDX, EBX, ECX from left to right), and then because ESI
vs EDI, EDI I see it less used, so why not that one.
